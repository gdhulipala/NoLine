This is an android application that was built to demonstrate my skills with respect to software application development involving multiple components such as barcode scanner, interacting with databases and multi screen activities. The application was built as a proof of concept idea that will enhance the customer shopping behaviour and at the same time gives a lot of data related to customer purchases.
