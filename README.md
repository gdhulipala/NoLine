This is an android application that was built to demonstrate my skills with respect to software application development involving multiple components such as barcode scanner, interacting with databases and multi screen activities. The application was entirely built from scratch that involved all the front end implemented in xml and the backend was completely written in Java. The application was built as a proof of concept idea that will enhance the customer shopping behaviour and at the same time gives a lot of data related to customer purchases.
